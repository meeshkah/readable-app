## Readable Frontend App

Readable is a little (tiny, really) brother of Reddit, in that without providing the authentication capabilities, it gives one the way to create, edit, and delete posts, and vote on them. 
It also provides the functionality to comment on the posts, vote on the comments, as well as edit and delete them. 
There is also a soring mechanism on posts list, giving user a way to sort the posts by date and voting score. 

## Installing and running

To install and start the app, run the following commands in this directory:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## TODO

There are still a lot of things to be done here, but it has been a really enjoyable exercise.
